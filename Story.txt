There once was boy named Elliot making a story on Github for his CS400 class. He didn't really know what to write because there were no guidelines as to what to write or how long
to make it besides "a paragraph". All that he did know was that he had to add two of his group members to his repository so they could had onto his story. He really hoped Yi and 
Jack knew what they were doing. 

Yi is here, but she also did not know exactly what she should do. The instruction our instructors and TAs gave us are ... confusing. She only knows she has to finish them... And since they did not give us enough information, she believes we can write whatever we like... Hope Jack will finish this story in a formal way.
